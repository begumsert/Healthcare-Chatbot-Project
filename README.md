# Healthcare-Chatbot-Project

This repository is for CSE 492 Graduation Project about Healthcare Chatbot.

# Abstract

This project details the design and implementation of a health chatbot system developed
on a private network, aimed at providing users with immediate health support and information
in today’s era where digital health solutions are gaining significance. Utilizing the NLU
capabilities of IBM Watson Assistant and NLP capabilities of Chatgpt OpenAI, the chatbot
analyzes users’ questions and provides informative responses about health symptoms.
Key features of the system include user authentication, processing health-related queries,
and an FAQ section that offers answers to frequently asked questions. The health chatbot
demonstrates the potential of AI-powered solutions to revolutionize patient care and acces-
sibility to health services.
